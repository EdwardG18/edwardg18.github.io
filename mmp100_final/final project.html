<h1>final statement</h1>

<p>For my final animation project I decide to do a power up, running, and flying sequence my artistic inspiration for this animation project was a scene form the series The Flash was testing his speed then runs faster than he ever could. I was able to make this as my own thing because my own because I use various elements in order to show that my character characteristic features and how he was able to reach a speed call overdrive. The best way for me to explain what happened was by making as short animation. The video is about Kenji powering up gathering his speed run faster so that that he can reach overdrive and complete his short-term goal. The media techniques that I use was rotoscoping. The animation was different form the storyboard concept because I mad my character power up from the beginning and that the reason why my animation project turn out the way it did.</p>
